[REFERENCE .ALT RFC once published here!]

The "Label" must be unique in the entire registry.  The value must be a
case insensitive punycode string without dots following the restrictions
on DNS names.

Adding records can be done on a first-come first-served basis.

The current contact(s) for review are reachable at
alt-registry@gnunet.org.
