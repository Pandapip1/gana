[REFERENCE .ALT RFC once published here!]

The "Label" must be unique in the entire registry.  The value must be a
case insensitive LDH label (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5890#section-2.3.1)
following the restrictions on DNS names.

Adding records can be done on a first-come first-served basis after GANA
committer review.

The current contact(s) for review are reachable at
alt-registry@gnunet.org.
