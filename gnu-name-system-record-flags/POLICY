Each registry entry should contain three values: the "Number" of the
record flags, which must be between 0 and 15,
the "Name" of the record flag, and a "Reference" with links
to further information about the record flag.

The "Name" must be unique in the entire registry.  The value must be a
case insensitive ASCII string and is restricted to alphanumeric
characters.

Adding flags is possible after expert review, using a
first-come-first-served policy for unique "Name" allocation.
Experts are responsible to ensure that the chosen "Name" is
appropriate for the record flag.

The current contact(s) for expert review are reachable at
gns-registry@gnunet.org.
