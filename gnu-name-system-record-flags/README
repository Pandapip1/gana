This registry is for GNU Name System Record Flags.

GNU Name System Record flags uniquely identify the different kinds
of key-value pairs that can be used as flags of a GNU Name System record.

This registry is used to ensure that the names and numeric values
used to identify record flags are uniquely defined and to
allow GNS resolvers implementors to find out details about the
respective semantics and human-readable syntax.
