This registry is for overlay protocols.

Overlay protocol numbers uniquely identify the different kinds
of protocols implemented to realize overlay service communication.

This registry is used to ensure that the names and numeric values
used to identify the protocols are uniquely defined and to
allow implementors to find out details about the respective semantics and
specifications.
