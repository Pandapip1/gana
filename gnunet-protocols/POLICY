Each registry entry should contain three values: the "Number" of the
protocol, which must be above 255 (to avoid conflicts with legacy
Internet protocols), the "Name" of the protocol, and a "Reference" with links
to further information about the record type.

The "Name" must be unique in the entire registry.  The value must be a
case insensitive ASCII string and is restricted to alphanumeric
characters.

Adding protocols is possible after expert review, using a
first-come-first-served policy for unique "Name" allocation.
Experts are responsible to ensure that the chosen "Name" is
appropriate for the record type.

The current contact(s) for expert review are reachable at
gns-registry@gnunet.org.
