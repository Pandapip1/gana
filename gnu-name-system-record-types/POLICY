Each registry entry should contain three values: the "Number" of the
record type, which must be above 65535 (to avoid conflicts with legacy
DNS record types), the "Name" of the record type, an optional
"Contact" for the payment method, and a "Reference" with links to
further information about the record type.

The "Name" must be unique in the entire registry.  The value must be a
case insensitive ASCII string and is restricted to alphanumeric
characters, dots and dashes.

Adding records is possible after expert review, using a
first-come-first-served policy for unique "Name" allocation.
Experts are responsible to ensure that the chosen "Name" is
appropriate for the payment method.

The current contact(s) for expert review are reachable at
gns-registry@gnunet.org.
