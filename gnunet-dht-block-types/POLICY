Each registry entry should contain three values: the "Number" of the
block type, the "Name" of the block type, and a "Reference" with links
to further information about the block type.

The "Name" must be unique in the entire registry.  The value must be a
case insensitive ASCII string and is restricted to alphanumeric
characters.

Adding records is possible after expert review, using a
first-come-first-served policy for unique "Name" allocation.
Experts are responsible to ensure that the chosen "Name" is
appropriate for the block type.

The current contact(s) for expert review are reachable at
gana@gnunet.org.
