This registry is for GNUnet DHT Block Types.

DHT Block Types types uniquely identify the different kinds
of blocks that can be found in the GNUnet DHT.

This registry is used to ensure that the names and numeric values
used to identify block types are uniquely defined and to
allow DHT implementors to find out details about the
respective semantics and human-readable syntax.
